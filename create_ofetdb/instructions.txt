This is a file containing instructions on how to create the tables in pgAdmin and insert seed OFET data into it.

1. In pgAdmin, create a new database named "ofetdb_testenv" (or whatever you choose, so long as you have the db info saved).

2. Ensure you have the appropriate Python libraries installed
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 
3. Run "create_ofetdb_tables.py," making sure that the kwargs/param_dict has the right database connection information, such as the database name, user/password, etc that you specified while creating the new database in pgAdmin.

If the execution is successful, you should be able to see empty tables in pgAdmin under your database.

4. In "import_combined_dataset.py," again check that the param_dict has the correct connection details. You can then run the file:

python import_combined_dataset.py

It may take several minutes to upload all database inserts, but monitor along the way to ensure there are no errors returned.

5. If you encounter any issues or need to troubleshoot, sometimes deleting and recreating the database in pgAdmin will solve the problem.

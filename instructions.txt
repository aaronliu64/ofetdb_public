This file contains instructions on how to add OFET data from a template to the database using the standardized excel template (Sample_Template.xlsx)

0. Install Anaconda and PostgreSQL. Clone this repository to your local computer.

1. In pgAdmin or psql, create a new database named "ofetdb_testenv" (or any preferred name). Make sure to save the database information for later use.

2. Create a new virtual environment for ofetdb, and then activate it using:

` conda create -n <name_of_env> python=3.11.4
` conda activate <name_of_env>

Then, ensure you have the appropriate Python libraries installed:

   ```bash
	`pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Change directory to "create_ofetdb". First, run the "create_ofetdb_tables.py", then "import_combined_dataset.py". Ensure that the kwargs/param_dict in the scripts contain the correct database connection information, 
such as the database name, user/password, etc., that was used to install PostgreSQL.

` python create_ofetdb_tables.py
` python import_combined_dataset.py

If the execution is successful, you should be able to see populated tables in pgAdmin under your database.


4. Now run the "run_template.ipynb" using Jupyter notebook. Before executing, double-check the file path name for the sample_template and the database connection information to ensure they are correct.

 
Important Note:

- You do not need to run the "read_template" notebook directly. It contains the back-end code required to extract relevant data from the template and enter it into the appropriate tables in the database. 
Running the run_template code is sufficient.

-For each new OFET data point you want to add to the database using the template, create a new Sample_Template file and fill in the appropriate information.

- The Sample_Template file contains information on how to fill in the OFET data


You should now be able to add OFET data to the database using the provided Excel template and Jupyter notebooks. If you encounter any issues, ensure you follow the instructions carefully and verify the database connection information and file paths.

This file contains instructions on how to add OFET data from a template to the database using the standardized excel template (Sample_Template.xlsx)


1. In pgAdmin, create a new database named "ofetdb_testenv" (or any preferred name). Make sure to save the database information for later use.

2. Ensure you have the appropriate Python libraries installed (check the requirements file in the main folder). The standard Anaconda package should suffice. If not already installed, use the following command to install the required library:

   ```bash
   pip install p

3. Run the "create_ofetdb_tables.py" script from the Create_ofetdb folder. Ensure that the kwargs/param_dict in the script contains the correct database connection information, such as the database name, user/password, etc., that was used to install PostgreSQL.

Example command to run the script:
python create_ofetdb_tables.py

If the execution is successful, you should be able to see empty tables in PG Admin under your database.

4. Now run the "run_template" Jupyter notebook. Before executing, double-check the file path name for the sample_template and the database connection information to ensure they are correct.

 
Important Note:

- You do not need to run the "read_template" notebook directly. It contains the back-end code required to extract relevant data from the template and enter it into the appropriate tables in the database. Running the run_template code is sufficient.

-The current version of the "run_template" file may give you a primary key error if you try to add data from the Sample_Template to a database that already contains seed data from the combined_seed and combined_measurement files from the Create_ofetdb folder. To avoid this error, create a new empty database in PG Admin with empty tables by following the instructions above, before running the "run_template" code.

-For each new OFET data point you want to add to the database using the template, create a new Sample_Template file and fill in the appropriate information.

- The Sample_Template file contains information on how to fill in the OFET data


You should now be able to add OFET data to the database using the provided Excel template and Jupyter notebooks. If you encounter any issues, ensure you follow the instructions carefully and verify the database connection information and file paths.
